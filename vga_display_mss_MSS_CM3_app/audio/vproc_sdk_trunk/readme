This is readme , a first hand document, for Gen SDK describes version information and documentation place holder.

The current Gen SDK is in draft stage. it currently has following sub-directories and files.

->Makefile - Master makefile. before using this set relevant build time environment variables in Makefile.globals

->Makefile.globals - container for all build options. user can make changes here to mention current system configuration.

->config.mk - defines all build options to compile-time variables

->docs - contains documentation on Generic SDK. Refer to Generic_SW_Architecture.docx for SDK hierarchy

->platform directory
  it further contais:
	-raspberry pi specific plaform ssl driver. Refer to SSL_Specification.docx for overview on SSL design and usage.
	-raspberry pi kernel(current tested 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img, base kernel 3.18.7). Refer to GenSDKBuildHowTo.docx inside platform/raspberry/docs for general setup guideline 
	 and gen sdk portability on pi
	-raspberry pi specific platform sound driver to register microsemi vproc device registered as sound card to kernel(compile and boot kernel with microsemi dts file). Refer to GenSDKBuildHowTo.docx for 
	"Building ALSA on Pi"
	-dts. required to register microsemi vproc device as sound card device to kernel

5. driver
	Contains an Generic HBI driver for all microsemi vproc family of devices. Behavior of the driver controlled by setting releavant options in makefile.globals.
	Refer to HBI_Specification.docx for overview of design and approach

6. lnxdriver
	Contains HBI driver for linux platform. refer to HBI_Linux_Driver_Specification.docx for overview of its features and usage

7. firmware 
	Placeholder to keep released firmware images, C-Style files, tools to release

8. tst
	placeholder for various test apps.

To Remove
In current SDK version, we have following redundant files  which are to be removed in final release version
1. env.sh - not required anymore. To be deleted
2. hbi_test from tst folder. Now we have hbi linux driver to test HBI interfaces. So this is redundant for linux platform. it can be either removed or redisgned for non-os platform
